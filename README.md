## I. Overview
"Original Food" is a project that deal with food tracebility. Today producers and customers are disconnected with no possibility to interact each other.
This application is going to connect them and promote trust across the network. It is going to garatee consumers about the origin and the freshness of the foods, but also garantee produceders that their names, values and investments are not improperly used by anyone.
Moreover alos the distribution companies will be garanteed regarding the products that they distribute.
For this reason we want to provide a platform where farmers can record their productions and issue for each of the package a unique code with place of origin, date of packaging & date of shipment.
At the same time also the company that distribute the products can record every distribution step in order to garanteed the delivery time and quality.
